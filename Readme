---Single Page Web Application---
>	I am able to provide the user with a much-enhanced experience.
>	Because less bandwidth is being consumed and no complete page refreshes are happening while the user navigates around the program, the program will seem to be quicker(Angular SPA: Why Single Page Applications, 2021).
>	This application will be much simpler to deploy in production, at least in terms of the client portion: all we need is a static server to serve.
>	I also use code splitting to divide the bundles into various portions if the situation requires it.
>	Using versioning in production, the frontend portion of the program is quite basic, allowing for simpler deployment and rollbacks to prior versions of the frontend if necessary.
